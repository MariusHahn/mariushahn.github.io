This a Website about myself. I just escaped life as an employee and went back to university. I'm a software engineer. I love building thinks that help people. The branches in which I was working in my short professional time were banks and automotive industry. Actullay I'm not focused on any business branch, this is just what I got so far. One of the most important things to me is that the project serves any purpose at the end. I don't like working for a year on a project to see then be thrown away. If possible, I'd love contributing on a project that makes the world a bit more, green, substainable or just better.
